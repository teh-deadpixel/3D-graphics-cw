Models were created using round cubes changed into quadspheres to create the planets and droid on top of the xwing
xwing -
a plane was extruded to a block shape. A loop cut was added and the object was then scaled and extruded multiple times to achieve the shape of the fuselage and cockpit
various shapes were created on top of the fuselage to add flaire
a sphere was added and then scaled down to create the droid on the body 
emmision shaders were used to give the main back engines a glow
a plane was used and mirrored to create the wings and cylinders were used to create the engine and main cannons by extruding and indenting
planets -
a round sphere was changed to a quadsphere and then the cloud and voronoi textures were added
parts of the planets were extruded along normals to create depressions 
and this emissions shaders were used to added glow to the depressed parts
